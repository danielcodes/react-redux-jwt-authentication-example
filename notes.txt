Things that need to be built out

[x] A sign up page, will be similar to login
[x] Have all pages inherit from one base page
[ ] Move the alert to under the navbar
[ ] A better landing page, tie the auth functionality together
[ ] Add a 404 page for routes that don't exists
[ ] Fix exports, too verbose...



Things that I learn as I implement these things
-After signup -> login, I wanted to display a message
solution is to pass in a state argument after the route
see, https://stackoverflow.com/q/41466055
accessed though, 'this.props.location.state.<field>'
